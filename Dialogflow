To train Dialogflow for the currency conversion functionality provided by your Flask application, follow these steps:

---------------------------Step 1: Create a Dialogflow Agent------------------------------------------------
Go to Dialogflow Console: Open the Dialogflow console at Dialogflow Console.
Create a New Agent: Click on the “Create Agent” button. Fill in the details (e.g., Agent name, default time zone, default language) and click “Create”.

----------------------------Step 2: Define Intents----------------------------------------------------------------
Intents are used to categorize user intentions. Create an intent for currency conversion.

Create an Intent:

Go to the “Intents” section.
Click on the “Create Intent” button.
Name the intent (e.g., “Currency Conversion”).
Add Training Phrases:

These are example phrases that users might say to trigger the intent. Add several variations such as:
"Convert 10 USD to EUR"
"How much is 100 GBP in INR?"
"Exchange 50 CAD to AUD"
Define Parameters and Entities:

Add parameters for the currencies and amount to capture user inputs.
Use Dialogflow’s built-in @sys.unit-currency entity for the source currency and amount.
Use @sys.currency-name entity for the target currency.
Set the parameter names (e.g., unit-currency, currency-name).
Set Up Responses:

In the “Responses” section, add a placeholder response like “Converting your currency...” which will be overridden by your webhook.

----------------------Step 3: Enable Webhook Fulfillment-------------------------------------------
Enable webhook fulfillment to forward the user's request to your Flask application.

Enable Webhook:
Go to the “Fulfillment” section in Dialogflow.
Enable the “Webhook” toggle.
Set the “URL” to the endpoint of your Flask application (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/webhook).

----------------------Step 4: Test the Integration---------------------------------------------------
Test in Dialogflow Console:

Go to the “Try it now” section in the Dialogflow console.
Enter a phrase like “Convert 10 USD to EUR” and verify that Dialogflow captures the parameters and returns the converted amount.
Refine and Improve:

Based on testing, refine the training phrases, parameter handling, and responses to improve accuracy and user experience.
