# ChatBot
Here I am building a currency converter Chatbot using dialogflow

Techniques Used
Web Framework (Flask):
Flask is used to create a web application that can handle HTTP requests and responses. It provides the necessary tools to build web endpoints and manage routes.
RESTful API Design:

JSON Handling:
The request.get_json() method is used to parse the incoming JSON request payload, extracting the required data for processing.
The response is also formatted as JSON using jsonify() for compatibility with API consumers.

HTTP Requests (Requests Library):
The requests library is used to make external HTTP requests to a currency conversion API. This library simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses.

External API Integration:
The application fetches real-time currency conversion rates from an external API (https://free.currconv.com/api/v7/convert). This integration allows the application to provide up-to-date conversion rates.
